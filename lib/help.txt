This API enables cross-origin requests to anywhere.
<br>
<br>
<br>

Usage:
<br>
/               Shows help<br>
/iscorsneeded   This is the only resource on this host which is served without CORS headers.<br>
/<url>          Create a request to <url>, and includes CORS headers in the response.<br>
<br>
If the protocol is omitted, it defaults to http (https if port 443 is specified).<br>
<br>
Cookies are disabled and stripped from requests.<br>
<br>
<br>
Redirects are automatically followed. For debugging purposes, each followed redirect results
in the addition of a X-CORS-Redirect-n header, where n starts at 1. These headers are not
accessible by the XMLHttpRequest API.<br>
After 5 redirects, redirects are not followed any more. The redirect response is sent back
to the browser, which can choose to follow the redirect (handled automatically by the browser).
<br>
The requested URL is available in the X-Request-URL response header.<br>
The final URL, after following all redirects, is available in the X-Final-URL response header.<br>
<br>
<br>
To prevent the use of the proxy for casual browsing, the API requires either the Origin
or the X-Requested-With header to be set. To avoid unnecessary preflight (OPTIONS) requests,
it's recommended to not manually set these headers in your code.<br>
